### Instructions
#### Requirements  
- Your UI should closely follow the provided design on figma – you may use different images 
for the profile picture and events. 
- The app bar needs to be built in flutter, it can’t be an image.  
- Your design must have a single page, with the posts, comments, and stats sections being changed only according to what the user selects – the whole page must not be rebuilt.

- Read up on the app bar’s shape property in the flutter docs 
- How can you **stack** the profile picture on top of the app bar?
